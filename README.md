### Library of digraphs for the Digraphs package of GAP ###



In this directory is a collection of various types of digraphs, which can be
loaded into the GAP computational algebra system using the [Digraphs
package](http://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/digraphs.php).  It is a
completely optional addition to the package, which can be used to produce
examples of digraphs for use in the package.



Getting digraphs-lib
--------------------
The latest version of this library is available at the following link:

https://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/digraphs/downloads

Simply download it and extract the archive into the root directory of your
Digraphs installation.  This should result in a `digraphs-lib` directory inside
your `digraphs` directory.



Using digraphs-lib
------------------
Once the library is installed, simply launch GAP, load the Digraphs package, and
use the `ReadDigraphs` function on one of the files in the `digraph-lib`
directory.  This will return a list of digraphs which can be used as required.

Here is an example GAP session:

```
gap> LoadPackage("digraphs", false);;
gap> filename := "~/gap/pkg/digraphs/digraphs-lib/latin.g6.gz";;
gap> latin_graphs := ReadDigraphs(filename);

Types of digraph available
--------------------------
The following files were created by the authors of the Digraphs package:

  * `acyclic.ds6.gz` - Acyclic graphs

  * `random.d6.gz` - A few randomly generated digraphs
  * `sparse.ds6.gz` - Sparse graphs (few edges per vertex)
  * `tournament.d6.gz` - Tournaments

The following files contain symmetric graphs taken from the [nauty and Traces
website](http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Graphs.html), by Brendan McKay and Adolfo
Piperno:

  * `ag.s6.gz` - Affine geometry graphs
  * `cfi.s6.gz` - Cai, Fuerer and Immerman graphs
  * `cmz.s6.gz` - Miyazaki graphs
  * `grid.s6.gz` - Grid graphs

  * `had.g6.gz` - Hadamard matrix graphs
  * `had-sw.g6.gz` - Hadamard matrix graphs with switched edges
  * `k.g6.gz` - Complete graphs
  * `latin.g6.gz` - Latin square graphs

  * `mz-aug2.s6.gz` - Augmented Miyazaki graphs 2
  * `paley.g6.gz` - Paley graphs

  * `sts.g6.gz` - Steiner triple system graphs
  * `sts-sw.g6.gz` - Steiner triple system graphs with switched edges
  * `triang.g6.gz` - Triangular graphs

There are also some additional files containing graphs coming from finite geometry:

  * `fining.p.gz` - contains some graphs comining from finite geometries:
    (1): vertices are the generators of the hermitian polar space H(5,4), two vertices are adjacent iff they are skew
    (2): vertices are the generators of the hermitian quadrangle H(4,4), two vertices are adjacent iff they are skew
    (3): vertices areh the points and lines of the classical generalized quadrangle Q(4,8), two vertics are adjacent iff
    they are incident (and no loops!). This is a bipartite graph with diameter 4 and undirected girth 8
    (4): the bipartite graph (see (3)) of an elation generalized quadrangle. This one was constructed as a coset geometry. 
    (5): the bipartite graph of the split Cayley hexagon of order 4, diameter is 6 and girth is 12.
    (6): the bipartite graph of the Ree-Tits generalized octagon! This one has diameter 8 and girth 16!
  
  * `polar_graphs.p.gz` A polar graph is by definition the point graph of a
     finite classical polar space. Note that such a geometry is a partial linear
     space, so not every pair of points is a pair of collinear points. Two
     points are adjacent iff they differe and they are collinear. The diamter of
     these graphs is 2, their undirected girth 3, the latter since these spaces
     contain lines.  Reading in this file requires around 4 Gb.

  * `dual_polar_graphs.p.gz` We consider again finite classical polar
     spaces. Such geometries contain points, lines, etc., up to maximal
     subspaces, which all have the same projective dimension. The vertices of a
     dual polar graph are these maximal subspaces, of dimension d say, and they
     are adjacent iff they differ and meet in a d-1 dimensional projective
     subspace. Reading in this file requres around 5Gb.
     
  * `generators_graphs.p.gz` (parts 1, 2 and 3). We consider again finite
      classical polar spaces. The vertices are the maximal subspaces and they
      are adjacent iff they differ and are skew. Reading part 2 requires almost
      6Gb, reading part 3 requires again 6Gb. Reading part 1 requires much less
      (around 1.5Gb).
      
  * `incidence_graphs.p.gz` a generalized polygon of gonality n is a point line
      geometry, such that if one considers the incidence graph, i.e. the
      vertices are the points and the lines, adjacency is incidence (withouth
      loops), then it has diameter n and girth 2n. All graphs in this repository
      are incidence graphs of generalized polygons. Note that by a famous
      theorem, thick GPs (i.e. at least three points on a line and dually, at
      least three lines on a point), have gonality 3,4,6 or 8. The repository
      contains the incidence graph of the smallest generalized octogon, some
      generalized hexagons, and a lot of generalized quadrangles, and some
      projective planes.  To read it completely, around 1.5Gb is requiered.
